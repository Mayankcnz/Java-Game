The Game is called Sokoban. It is a single player game in which the player pushes the boxes around the warehouse, trying to get them to storage 
Locations. This Game offers several functionalities such as an Undo button, which basically re-rolls the previous moives being done. 
The Game also has a path finding mechanism which uses breadth first search to find the shortest path, selected by the user. 
The player is confined to the board, and may only move horizontally and vertically onto empty squares. If the player move onto a box, it will push 
one square beyond if an empty square after the box exists.
